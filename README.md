# RAD2_DreamChallenge
The purpose of the RA2-DREAM Challenge is to develop an automated method to quickly and accurately quantify the degree of joint damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Based on radiographs of the hands and feet, a novel, automated scoring method could be applied broadly for patient care and research.
